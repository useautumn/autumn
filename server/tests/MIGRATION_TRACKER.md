## Utility Files (Don't Migrate)
These are helper files, not tests:
- `tests/utils/compare.ts`
- `tests/utils/advancedUsageUtils.ts`

## Migration Prompt

When ready to migrate a file, use this prompt:

```
Migrate the test file [FILE_PATH] from using global state to isolated test context.

Reference the migration guide at @server/tests/MIGRATION_GUIDE.md for the full pattern.

**Critical Requirements:**
1. DO NOT remove any existing test logic - preserve ALL test cases and assertions
2. DO NOT remove any force_checkout tests or other edge case tests
3. Compare line-by-line with the original file to ensure nothing is lost
4. Replace the original file (not create a .new.test.ts file)
5. Update testCase ID to match original (e.g., "basic2" not "basic2-new")

After migration, run: `bun test [FILE_PATH]` to verify all tests pass.
```

## Progress Summary
- **Total Files**: 30
- **Migrated**: 8 (27%)
- **In Progress**: 0 (0%)
- **Remaining**: 22 (73%)

## Notes
- Start with basic tests (basic2-10) as they're simpler
- Downgrade and upgrade tests may be more complex
- Archived tests may not need migration
- Each migration should preserve ALL test logic and assertions
