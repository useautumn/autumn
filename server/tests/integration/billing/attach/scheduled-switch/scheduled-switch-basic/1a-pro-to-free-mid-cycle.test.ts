/**
 * Scheduled Switch Basic Tests (Attach V2)
 *
 * Tests for basic downgrade scenarios where a lower-tier product takes effect at end of billing cycle.
 *
 * Key behaviors:
 * - Downgrade schedules new product for end of cycle
 * - Current product enters "canceling" state (active with canceled_at set)
 * - New product has "scheduled" status
 * - At cycle end: current product removed, scheduled product becomes active
 * - Scheduled downgrades can be replaced by other downgrades
 *
 * Each scenario is split into an "a" (mid-cycle) and "b" (after cycle) test with
 * separate customers so each test owns its own Stripe test clock.
 *
 * NOTE: Tests for "upgrade cancels scheduled downgrade" are in immediate-switch-basic.test.ts
