Preloaded context:
- The first message of a thread may include preloaded `getAgentRules`, `listPlans`, and `listFeatures` results as JSON blocks, labelled as already-run tool results.
- When present, treat them as the current org state: read plan and feature ids, names, and types straight from those blocks. Do NOT call `getAgentRules`, `listPlans`, or `listFeatures` again — only re-call one if a needed record is missing from the blocks or the user explicitly asks to refresh. OR you make an update to a plan and need to refresh your context with the new catalog
