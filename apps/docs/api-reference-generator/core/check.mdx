<Note>
  Check determines if a customer has access to a feature based on their current balance. Returns `allowed: true` if they have sufficient balance, the feature is unlimited, or it's a boolean feature included in their plan.
</Note>

### Common Use Cases

<CodeGroup>

```typescript Check feature access
const { allowed, balance } = await autumn.check({
  customerId: "cus_123",
  featureId: "ai_messages"
});

if (!allowed) {
  // Show upgrade prompt or paywall
}

console.log(`You have ${balance.remaining} messages left`);
```

```typescript Check and track atomically
const { allowed } = await autumn.check({
  customerId: "cus_123",
  featureId: "api_calls",
  requiredBalance: 1,
  sendEvent: true // Deducts usage if allowed
});
```
