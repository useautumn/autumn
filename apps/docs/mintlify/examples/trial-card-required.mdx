title: Trial - card required
description: Enable a trial period where customers must provide payment information upfront.
---

Card-required trials give customers full access to a paid plan for a limited time. Payment information is collected upfront, and customers are billed after the trial ends.

Customers can cancel anytime during the trial period. If they cancel, their account downgrades when the trial expires. If they don't cancel, billing begins automatically.

Companies using this model include Lindy, Descript and Fxyer.

## Configure Pricing


You can toggle on a free trial for a plan when creating it, or in the "plan settings" section. By default, the "card required" flag is set to true.

<Accordion title="Adding a trial fee (optional workaround)">

You can optionally charge a small upfront fee for trial access, often used to qualify leads and reduce trial abuse while maintaining low barrier to entry.

Create an add-on plan, with a one-time price. We will attach the plan with a free trial, and the trial-fee add on at the same time.

## Implementation

#### Enabling the trial

Enable the trial with the normal plan enablement flow. Only customers that have not used the trial before will be able to access it.

<CodeGroup>

```tsx React
import { useCustomer } from "autumn-js/react";

const { attach } = useCustomer();

<Button onClick={() => attach({ planId: "pro" })}>
  Start Trial
</Button>;
```

```typescript TypeScript
import { Autumn } from "autumn-js";

const autumn = new Autumn({ secretKey: "am_sk_test_1234" });

const response = await autumn.billing.attach({
  customerId: "user_123",
  planId: "pro",
});

// Redirect to Stripe Checkout for card collection
redirect(response.paymentUrl);
```

```python Python
from autumn_sdk import Autumn

autumn = Autumn("am_sk_test_1234")

response = await autumn.billing.attach(
    customer_id="user_123",
    plan_id="pro",
)
# Redirect to response.payment_url
```

```bash cURL
curl -X POST "https://api.useautumn.com/v1/attach" \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer am_sk_test_1234" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{
    "customer_id": "user_123",
    "plan_id": "pro"
  }'
```

</CodeGroup>

<Accordion title="With trial fee">

<CodeGroup>

```tsx React
import { useCustomer } from "autumn-js/react";

const { attach } = useCustomer();

<Button onClick={() => attach({ planIds: ["pro", "trial_fee"] })}>
  Start Trial
</Button>;
```

```typescript TypeScript
import { Autumn } from "autumn-js";

const autumn = new Autumn({ secretKey: "am_sk_test_1234" });

const response = await autumn.billing.attach({
  customerId: "user_123",
  planIds: ["pro", "trial_fee"],
});

redirect(response.paymentUrl);
```

```python Python
from autumn_sdk import Autumn

autumn = Autumn("am_sk_test_1234")

response = await autumn.billing.attach(
    customer_id="user_123",
    plan_ids=["pro", "trial_fee"],
)
# Redirect to response.payment_url
```

```bash cURL
curl -X POST "https://api.useautumn.com/v1/attach" \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer am_sk_test_1234" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{
    "customer_id": "user_123",
    "plan_ids": ["pro", "trial_fee"]
  }'
```

<Tip>
You may want to block certain users from accessing the trial. You can pass in `freeTrial: false` into the attach request to disable the trial.
</Tip>

After the trial ends, the customer will be automatically charged the full price of the plan. 

#### Ending the trial early

You can end the trial early by cancelling the plan immediately, and attaching it again. You may want to pass in a `reward` into the attach request to give the customer a discount for upgrading early.

<CodeGroup>

```tsx React
import { useCustomer } from "autumn-js/react";

const { updateSubscription, attach } = useCustomer();

const handleEarlyEnd = async () => {
  // Cancel the trial immediately
  await updateSubscription({
    planId: "pro",
    cancelAction: "cancel_immediately",
  });
  
  // Attach the plan again with a reward
  await attach({
    planId: "pro",
    reward: "early_end",
  });
    
  console.log("Trial ended early");
};

<Button onClick={handleEarlyEnd}>Upgrade Now</Button>;
```

```typescript TypeScript
import { Autumn } from "autumn-js";

const autumn = new Autumn({ secretKey: "am_sk_test_1234" });

// Cancel the trial immediately
await autumn.billing.update({
  customerId: "user_123",
  planId: "pro",
  cancelAction: "cancel_immediately",
});

// Attach the plan again with a reward
const response = await autumn.billing.attach({
  customerId: "user_123",
  planId: "pro",
  reward: "early_end",
});

console.log("Trial ended early");
```

```python Python
from autumn_sdk import Autumn

autumn = Autumn("am_sk_test_1234")

# Cancel the trial immediately
await autumn.billing.update(
    customer_id="user_123",
    plan_id="pro",
    cancel_action="cancel_immediately",
)

# Attach the plan again with a reward
response = await autumn.billing.attach(
    customer_id="user_123",
    plan_id="pro",
    reward="early_end",
)

print("Trial ended early")
```

```bash cURL
# Cancel the trial immediately
curl -X POST "https://api.useautumn.com/v1/billing/update" \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer am_sk_test_1234" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{
    "customer_id": "user_123",
    "plan_id": "pro",
    "cancel_action": "cancel_immediately"
  }'

# Attach the plan again with a reward
curl -X POST "https://api.useautumn.com/v1/attach" \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer am_sk_test_1234" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{
    "customer_id": "user_123",
    "plan_id": "pro",
    "reward": "early_end"
  }'
```

</CodeGroup>

#### Cancelling the trial

Customers can cancel the trial at any time. If they cancel, the plan will expire when the trial ends. If there is an `auto-enable` plan (eg your free tier), this will then be enabled.

You can uncancel the trial plan by attaching it again.

<CodeGroup>

```tsx React
import { useCustomer } from "autumn-js/react";

const { updateSubscription } = useCustomer();

<Button onClick={() => updateSubscription({ 
  planId: "pro",
  cancelAction: "cancel_end_of_cycle" 
})}>
  Cancel Trial
</Button>;
```

```typescript TypeScript
import { Autumn } from "autumn-js";

const autumn = new Autumn({ secretKey: "am_sk_test_1234" });

await autumn.billing.update({
  customerId: "user_123",
  planId: "pro",
  cancelAction: "cancel_end_of_cycle",
});

console.log("Trial cancelled");
```

```python Python
from autumn_sdk import Autumn

autumn = Autumn("am_sk_test_1234")

await autumn.billing.update(
    customer_id="user_123",
    plan_id="pro",
    cancel_action="cancel_end_of_cycle",
)

print("Trial cancelled")
```

```bash cURL
curl -X POST "https://api.useautumn.com/v1/billing/update" \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer am_sk_test_1234" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{
    "customer_id": "user_123",
    "plan_id": "pro",
    "cancel_action": "cancel_end_of_cycle"
  }'
```
