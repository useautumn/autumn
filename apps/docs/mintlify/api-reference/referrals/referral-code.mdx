title: "Create a referral code"
openapi: "productsapi POST /referrals/code"
---

This endpoint creates or retrieves a unique referral code for a customer within a specific referral program. 

<Tip>
  A referral code is unique per customer within each program. On the first call, a new code is created, but subsequent calls will return the same existing code for that customer and program combination.
</Tip>

<Note>
  The `program_id` parameter refers to the referral program ID that you define when creating a referral program in the Autumn dashboard. Each program can have different rewards and rules.
</Note>

{/* ## How it works

1. **First call**: Creates a new unique referral code for the customer
2. **Subsequent calls**: Returns the existing code for that customer/program pair  
3. **Code sharing**: Customers can share their referral code with others
4. **Redemption**: Other customers can redeem the code using the [redeem endpoint](/api-reference/products/referral-redeem)

- **Customer referral programs**: Allow customers to generate codes to share with friends
