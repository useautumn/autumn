This endpoint is for tracking usage events in Autumn, so feature usage can be limited or billed for.

<Tip>
  {" "}
  If the `customer_id` you send doesn't already exist, Autumn will automatically
  create a new customer. You can optionally set the properties of this new customer
  through the `customer_data` field.
