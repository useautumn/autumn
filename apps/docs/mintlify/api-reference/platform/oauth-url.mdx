title: "Generate Stripe OAuth URL"
openapi: "platform POST /platform/oauth_url"

<Info>
  Generates a Stripe Connect OAuth URL for a platform organization. Use this to allow your tenants to connect their Stripe accounts through the OAuth flow.
</Info>

## OAuth Flow

After generating the OAuth URL:

1. Redirect your tenant to the `oauth_url`
2. User authorizes their Stripe account
3. Stripe redirects to Autumn's callback URL
4. Autumn processes the authorization and redirects to your `redirect_url`
5. Your `redirect_url` will receive query parameters:
   - `success=true` or `success=false`
   - `message=...` (if error occurred)

<Note>
  OAuth state is stored in Upstash with a 10-minute expiry. The organization must have been created via the platform API before generating an OAuth URL.
