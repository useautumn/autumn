<Info>
  Updates a platform organization's Stripe Connect configuration. Associates a Stripe account ID with the organization using your master Stripe credentials.
</Info>

## When to Use This Endpoint

Use this endpoint when you want to manage Stripe accounts on behalf of your tenants using your own Stripe Connect credentials, rather than having them go through the OAuth flow.

## Validation

- Your organization must have the corresponding Stripe secret key connected (test/live)
- The endpoint validates that your master Stripe account can access the provided account ID
- If validation fails, you'll receive a descriptive error message

<Note>
  The `master_org_id` is automatically set to your organization ID. All Stripe operations for the tenant will use your master Stripe credentials with the tenant's account ID.
</Note>

<Warning>
  At least one of `test_account_id` or `live_account_id` must be provided in the request.
</Warning>
