Features represent the parts of your product that you want to control access to, based on the pricing plan a customer is on. There are 2 key types of features you can create:

- **Metered features**: features that require you to keep track of a usage balance (eg, credits, API requests)
- **Boolean features**: features that can be either enabled or disabled (eg, access to a premium analytics dashboard).

When you create a feature, you can set a display name, and it's ID. This will be used to identify the feature when you make API calls to Autumn, to check or tracking usage of the feature.

## Metered features

Metered features can either be `consumable` or `non-consumable`.
- **Consumable**: features that can be used up and replenished, either by recurring resets or purchases. For example, credits, API requests. 
- **Non-consumable**: features that are used persistently. For example, seats, storage, workspaces.

When adding features to a plan, you will be able to set reset cycles for `consumable` features, and proration behavior for `non-consumable` features.

Under the "advanced" section of the feature creation sheet, you can also define [event names](/documentation/customers/tracking-usage#using-event-names). This gives you more control over how events interact with customer balances in Autumn. 

Metered features can each act as their own, standlone balance, or be added to a [credit system](/documentation/pricing/credits). This lets you define credit costs per feature, and let many features draw from a common credit balance. 

## Boolean features

Boolean features are for your features that can be either enabled or disabled. Think of them like feature flags to gate specific parts of your application based on what product a user has (eg, access to a premium analytics dashboard).

For these features, there is no configuration needed to be set. If you add them to a product, users on that product will be granted [access to the feature](/documentation/customers/check#checking-boolean-features).
