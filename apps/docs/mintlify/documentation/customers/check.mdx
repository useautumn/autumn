title: "Checking access"
description: "Learn how to check feature access with the `check` endpoint"
---

When you create a plan in Autumn, you define what features your customers on that plan get access to.

The `check` method returns the `allowed` field in real-time to check if a customer should have access to a feature. You can use this to block access and prompt an upsell.

## The `allowed` field

The `allowed` field will return `true` for a given feature if:
- The customer has an active plan with this feature
- The customer has an active plan with a `credit_system` that grants this feature
- The plan feature is <Badge>included</Badge> or <Badge>prepaid</Badge>, and the current balance is greater than the `required_balance` parameter
- The plan feature is <Badge>usage-based</Badge>, and the user has not exceeded their max spend limit
- The plan feature is <Badge>unlimited</Badge> or a <Badge>boolean</Badge> feature

Under these conditions, you should allow your customer to use the feature. You can then [record the usage event](/documentation/customers/tracking-usage/) so Autumn can update the `allowed` field as necessary.

## Checking metered features

Before your customer uses a feature, you can check if the customer is allowed to use it and their current usage.

<Info>
**Example**

Let's imagine you have a free plan for a chatbot that allows 5 messages per month. Before your customer sends an AI message, you can check if they have any left.

If they still have messages remaining, they'll be allowed to send an AI message.

```tsx React
import { useCustomer } from "autumn-js/react";

const { check } = useCustomer();

// check the customer state object locally (no API call)
const { data } = check({ featureId: "messages" });
```

```javascript Node.js
import { Autumn as autumn } from "autumn-js";

const { data } = await autumn.check({
  customer_id: "user-123",
  feature_id: "messages",
});
```

```python Python
import asyncio
from autumn import Autumn

autumn = Autumn("secret_key")

async def main():
  check = await autumn.check(customer_id="user-123", feature_id="messages")
  allowed = check.allowed

asyncio.run(main())
```

```bash cURL
curl -X POST "https://api.useautumn.com/v1/check" \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer am_sk_1234567890" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{
    "customer_id": "user-123",
    "feature_id": "messages",
  }'
```

<Tip>
Even if your product doesn't have usage limits (ie your feature is purely usage-based), you can still use the above method to prevent usage if a customer's payment fails.

## Checking for a required balance

If you know the balance a user will consume in advance, you can specify it with the `required_balance` parameter. This means you can prevent a user from starting a process that would consume more than their current balance.

By default, `required_balance` is 1, so not passing this parameter will return `allowed: true` as long as the customer has a feature balance of 1 or more.

<CodeGroup>

```tsx React
import { useCustomer } from "autumn-js/react";

const { check } = useCustomer();

const { data } = check({ featureId: "messages", requiredBalance: 3 });
```

```javascript Node.js
import { Autumn } from "autumn-js";

const autumn = new Autumn({
  secretKey: 'am_sk_42424242',
});

const { data } = await autumn.check({
  customer_id: "user_or_org_id_from_auth",
  feature_id: "ai-messages",
  required_balance: 3,
});
```

```python Python
import asyncio
from autumn import Autumn

autumn = Autumn('am_sk_42424242')

async def main():
  check = await autumn.check(
    customer_id="user_or_org_id_from_auth",
    feature_id="ai-messages",
    required_balance=3
  )
  allowed = check.allowed

asyncio.run(main())
```

```bash cURL {7}
curl -X POST "https://api.useautumn.com/v1/check" \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer am_sk_42424242" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{
    "customer_id": "user_or_org_id_from_auth",
    "feature_id": "ai-messages",
    "required_balance": 3
  }'
```

## Checking and reserving usage

You can check access and record usage in a single, atomic API call using the `send_event` field. The usage value deducted from the balance will be the `required_balance` parameter. This is useful for concurrent events.

<CodeGroup>

```javascript Node.js
import { Autumn } from "autumn-js";

const autumn = new Autumn({
  secretKey: 'am_sk_42424242',
});

const { data } = await autumn.check({
  customer_id: "user_or_org_id_from_auth",
  feature_id: "api_calls",
  required_balance: 3,
  send_event: true,
});
```

```python Python
import asyncio
from autumn import Autumn

autumn = Autumn('am_sk_42424242')

async def main():
  check = await autumn.check(
      customer_id="user_or_org_id_from_auth",
      feature_id="api_calls",
      required_balance=3,
      send_event=True,
  )
  allowed = check.allowed

asyncio.run(main())
```

```bash cURL {7-8}
curl -X POST "https://api.useautumn.com/v1/check" \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer am_sk_42424242" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{
    "customer_id": "user_or_org_id_from_auth",
    "feature_id": "ai-messages",
    "required_balance": 3,
    "send_event": true
  }'
```

</CodeGroup>

If the operation fails, you can then "refund" the usage with a negative usage `value` in the `track` endpoint.

<CodeGroup>

```javascript Node.js
import { Autumn } from "autumn-js";

const autumn = new Autumn({
  secretKey: 'am_sk_42424242',
});

const { data } = await autumn.track({
  customer_id: "user_or_org_id_from_auth",
  feature_id: "api_calls",
  value: -3,
});
```

```python Python
import asyncio
from autumn import Autumn

autumn = Autumn('am_sk_42424242')

async def main():
  await autumn.track(
    customer_id="user_or_org_id_from_auth",
    feature_id="api_calls",
    value=-3,
  )
```

```bash cURL
curl -X POST "https://api.useautumn.com/v1/track" \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer am_sk_42424242" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{
    "customer_id": "user_or_org_id_from_auth",
    "feature_id": "api_calls",
    "value": -3
  }'
```
</CodeGroup>

## Checking boolean features

For simple on/off features, use the endpoint to determine if a customer has access. Alternatively you can just check if they have access to a certain plan.

```tsx React
const { check } = useCustomer();

// check if the customer has access to a plan
const isPremium = check({ productId: "premium" });

// check if the customer has access to a feature
const dashboardAccess = check({ featureId: "premium-dashboard" });
```
