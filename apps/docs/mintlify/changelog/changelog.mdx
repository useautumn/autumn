Merry Christmas! 🎄

  ## RevenueCat integration

We just released a new integration with RevenueCat, to let you manage your mobile app subscriptions and billing with Autumn. 

This is especially helpful for users that have a mix of web and mobile users, and want to manage their billing in one place.

- **RevenueCat integration**: [Documentation](/documentation/external-providers/revenuecat)

<Note>

  ## List and aggregate events endpoints

We just released two new endpoints to retrieve usage data that your customers have sent to Autumn. 

You can use this to display a billing event log, and a timeseries chart of usage data, so you can provide first-class billing observability out of the box!

- **List Events**: [React hooks](/react/hooks/useListEvents) and [API reference](/api-reference/events/list-events)
- **Aggregate Events**: [React hooks](/react/hooks/useAggregateEvents) and [API reference](/api-reference/events/aggregate-events)

  ## Autumn is live in us-east

  Autumn is live on US-East! Previously all requests were hitting our us-west DB.

  Now, we're reading and writing from multiple Redis caches, so both checking feature balances and tracking usage events are faster and more reliable.

  More regions coming soon!
