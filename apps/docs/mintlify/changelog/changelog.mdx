<Update label="February 25th 2026">
  ## Volume-Based Tiered Pricing

  You can now choose between graduated and volume-based tiered pricing for your plans. With volume pricing, the entire usage quantity falls into a single tier instead of splitting across tiers — useful for models where the per-unit price depends on total consumption.

  - **Two tier modes**: Choose graduated (split across tiers) or volume (single tier applies to all units)
  - **Backward compatible**: Existing graduated plans work without changes; volume is opt-in via `tier_behavior`
  - **Full stack**: Supported in the plan editor, attach/checkout previews, Stripe invoices, and the API


  ## Batch Attach

  Attach multiple plans to a customer in a single API request. Each plan can have its own customization, feature quantities, and trial settings — all validated and applied atomically with a distributed lock.

  - **One request, multiple plans**: Attach several plans at once with per-plan customization
  - **Preview support**: Preview the combined batch before committing via `/billing.preview_multi_attach`
  - **Concurrency safe**: Distributed lock prevents conflicting concurrent attaches

  ## Lazy Entitlement Resets

  Entitlement resets now happen lazily on read, so customers see fresh balances instantly without waiting for a cron cycle. An atomic Postgres function and Redis Lua script prevent double-resets under concurrency.

  - **Instant resets**: Stale entitlements are reset the moment they're fetched
  - **Atomic & safe**: Per-row locking in Postgres and atomic Redis Lua patching prevent double-resets
  - **Hardened cron fallback**: Batch reset cron bounded with max iterations and timeouts

  ## RevenueCat integration

We just released a new integration with RevenueCat, to let you manage your mobile app subscriptions and billing with Autumn. 

This is especially helpful for users that have a mix of web and mobile users, and want to manage their billing in one place.

- **RevenueCat integration**: [Documentation](/documentation/external-providers/revenuecat)

<Note>
This is currently in beta, please reach out to us on [Discord](https://discord.gg/STqxY92zuS) or email us at hey@useautumn.com to get access.

  ## List and aggregate events endpoints

We just released two new endpoints to retrieve usage data that your customers have sent to Autumn. 

You can use this to display a billing event log, and a timeseries chart of usage data, so you can provide first-class billing observability out of the box!

- **List Events**: [React hooks](/react/hooks/useListEvents) and [API reference](/api-reference/events/list-events)
- **Aggregate Events**: [React hooks](/react/hooks/useAggregateEvents) and [API reference](/api-reference/events/aggregate-events)

  ## Autumn is live in us-east

  Autumn is live on US-East! Previously all requests were hitting our us-west DB.

  Now, we're reading and writing from multiple Redis caches, so both checking feature balances and tracking usage events are faster and more reliable.

  More regions coming soon!
