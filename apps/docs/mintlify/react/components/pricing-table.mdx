The pricing table component displays your available plans, plan features and pricing. 

The pricing card button will dynamically update it's text (eg upgrade, downgrade) and `disabled` state based on the user's current product and plan, and handle payments.

You can use the component as is, or download the shadcn/ui component and edit it to your needs.

**Use React component directly**

```jsx
import { PricingTable } from "autumn-js/react";
```

**Download shadcn/ui component**

<CodeGroup>
```bash npm
npx shadcn@latest add https://ui.useautumn.com/pricing-table
```

```bash pnpm
pnpm dlx shadcn@latest add https://ui.useautumn.com/pricing-table
```

```bash yarn
yarn dlx shadcn@latest add https://ui.useautumn.com/pricing-table
```

```bash bun
bunx --bun shadcn@latest add https://ui.useautumn.com/pricing-table
```

</CodeGroup>

This will download the pricing-table component in your `/components` directory, under a `/autumn` folder.

#### Usage

```javascript
import { PricingTable } from "@components/autumn/pricing-table";

export const PricingTableExample = () => (
  <div>
    <PricingTable productDetails={productDetails} />
  </div>
);
```

<Check>
The Pricing Table component calls the `products` endpoint, which does not require a `customer_id`. This means you can display the pricing table to unauthenticated users.
</Check>


The component can take in `productDetails`, which can be used to pass in content that can override the default contents (which are generated from your Autumn products). The example below was used to render the screenshot above.

```tsx [expandable]
const productDetails = [
  {
    id: "free",
    description: "A great free plan to get started with",
  },
  {
    id: "pro",
    description: "For all your extra messaging needs",
    recommendText: "Most Popular",
    price: {
      primaryText: "$10/month",
      secondaryText: "billed monthly",
    },
    items: [
      {
        featureId: "messages",
      },
      {
        primaryText: "Premium support",
        secondaryText: "Get help from our team",
      },
    ],
  },
  {
    id: "pro_annual",
  },
  {
    id: "premium",
    description: "For those of you who are really serious",
  },
  {
    id: "premium_annual",
  },
];
```

You can choose which products should be displayed, and what items each card should have. The items array can either take an object with `primaryText` and `secondaryText` properties, or a string with the `featureId`, which will just take the item from Autumn's default contents.

#### Scenarios

When you install `pricing-table`, a `@/lib/autumn/pricing-table-content.tsx` file is also installed. This file contains the pricing card button texts for each `scenario`, which you can customize how you want.

```tsx /lib/autumn/get-checkout-content.tsx [expandable]
import { type Product } from "autumn-js";

export const getPricingTableContent = (product: Product) => {
  const { scenario, free_trial, properties } = product;
  const { is_one_off, has_prepaid, has_trial } = properties;

  if (has_trial) {
    return {
      buttonText: <p>Start Free Trial</p>,
    };
  }

  switch (scenario) {
    case "scheduled":
      return {
        buttonText: <p>Plan Scheduled</p>,
      };

    case "active":
      if (has_prepaid) {
        return {
          buttonText: <p>Update Plan</p>,
        };
      }

      return {
        buttonText: <p>Current Plan</p>,
      };

    case "new":
      if (is_one_off) {
        return {
          buttonText: <p>Purchase</p>,
        };
      }

      return {
        buttonText: <p>Get started</p>,
      };

    case "renew":
      return {
        buttonText: <p>Renew</p>,
      };

    case "upgrade":
      return {
        buttonText: <p>Upgrade</p>,
      };

    case "downgrade":
      return {
        buttonText: <p>Downgrade</p>,
      };

    case "cancel":
      return {
        buttonText: <p>Cancel Plan</p>,
      };

    default:
      return {
        buttonText: <p>Get Started</p>,
      };
  }
};
```
## Build your own

Display a list of the products you offer by fetching your product data from Autumn's API. This gives you a dynamic, single source of truth for your app's pricing plans.

<CodeGroup>

```tsx React
import { useCustomer, usePricingTable } from "autumn-js/react";

const { products, isLoading, error } = usePricingTable();
```

```typescript Node.js
import { Autumn as autumn } from "autumn-js";

const { data, error } = await autumn.products({
  customer_id: "user_123",
});
```

</CodeGroup>

Each product in the array returned will contain a `scenario` enum, that can be used to determine its relation to the user's currenct product.

This can be used to control the button text of each pricing card you display. See our shadcn/ui pricing table texts for an example.

| Scenario    | Description                                                                      |
| ----------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `upgrade`   | The product is an upgrade to the user's current product                          |
| `downgrade` | The product is a downgrade to the user's current product                         |
| `cancel`    | The product is a free product which would cancel the user's current subscription |
| `renew`     | The product would be a renewal of a product that's scheduled to downgrade        |
| `scheduled` | The product is already scheduled to start at a future date (eg, for downgrades)  |
| `active`    | The product is already active                                                    |
